<h1>Looking Back</h1>
<h2>Through the course of this class, I’ve learned how to use GarageBand, Clips, and SketchesSchool. I really enjoyed the SketchesSchool because I love to draw and have always wanted to see what it’s like to draw on an Ipad. The Clips is one thing I struggled with. I struggled with this because I dont necessarily like being in front of a camera or recording my voice. However, it was cool to learn how it works. The most fun to me was GarageBand because I have a deep love for music. I’ve always wanted to see what it feels like to make a song and this gave me a taste of what its like. I might even try to produce a song for my artist friends in the future. In order to complete any of these creative things I have to put myself in a creative mindset. Whether that’s listening to music or having a tune in my head that I need to get out.</h2>
